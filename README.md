Swaption Pricing and Hedging with Hull-White One Factor Model

Morong Li, Elva Ye

SwaptionPricing used QuantLib library to first calibrate Hull-White One Factor model. Based on the model, 100 swaptions at 2008/07/01 are priced with Jamshidian method and Monte Carlo simulation, pricing errors are calculated and exported to csv file.

SwaptionHedging calculated daily swaption value and underyling swap value from 2008/07/01 to 2008/10/31, based on Delta value, the PnL of delta-hedged swaption can be calculated to see the performance of delta hedging.
