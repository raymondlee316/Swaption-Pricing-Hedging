Morong Li, Elva Ye

SwaptionPricing used QuantLib library to price 100 swaptions at 2008/07/01 with Jamshidian method and Monte Carlo simulation, and calculate the pricing errors.

SwaptionHedging calculated daily swaption value and underyling swap value from 2008/07/01 to 2008/10/31, based on Delta value, the PnL of delta-hedged swaption can be calculated to see the performance of delta hedging.
